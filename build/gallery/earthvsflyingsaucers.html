        <p class="single-description">The 1956 science fiction film <em>Earth vs the Flying Saucers</em>, may not be very well-known, but was a  huge influence on my favorite filmmaker, Tim Burton. The special effects for the film were created by the legendary Ray Harryhausen, and many scenes in the movie were directly referenced 40 years later in Burton's film <em>Mars Attacks!</em>. In 2007, a "colorized" version of the 1956 film was released, with the colors intentionally made to look semi-campy. For this painting, I tried to replicate that colorized version. In the background is the US Capitol building being attacked by flying saucers, in the midground are 2 aliens, and in the foreground is the character General Hanley, who has his brain analyzed by the aliens. For the style of this painting, I attempted to use the color drip and splatter effects I had used in some of my undergrad work. This is one of the paintings I did while working out of a temporary studio in downtown Columbus, OH in May 2012.</p>
