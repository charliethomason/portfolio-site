        <p>This photo of Amanda and I was taken our first day in Innsbruck, on a walk down the trail near my parent's house. We were still extremely tired from the long flight, but it was such a beautiful day that we had to get out and enjoy it. This lovely green hill at the foothills of the mountain provided the perfect backdrop for our first portrait together in Austria.</p>

These colorful houses that line the Inn River are very iconic looking and I was happy to squeeze so many of them into one photo with my 7-14mm wide-angle lens. The sky behind the mountains is slightly blown-out, but overall this is one of the most brightly colorful photos I took in Innsbruck.</p>

        <p>This amazing view is what we'd see each day on our walk to the nearby bus stop. We walked down a trail near my parents' house in Rum, which led over hills and past farms, and eventually takes you to the neighboring village of Arzl. Down below you can see the city of Innsbruck, as well as the Calvary Chapel up on a hill. At the time, I commented that it all looked like The Shire from <em>Lord of the Rings.</em></p>

In the morning, some delivery trucks are allowed to drive through, but most of the day it's a pedestrian and bike-only area. We came here many times to go to coffee shops and restaurants, and as a way to escape the bustle of traffic.</p>

It was renovated in 1880 and again in the 1970s, but if you walk around the back of the castle you can still see the old stone walls that haven't been painted white like the front. We enjoyed walking all through the castle, as well as through the surrounding forests. We even saw the Bacchus Grotto, which is like a dungeon cave carved into the nearby mountainside.</p>

Strangely, it was much colder inside the church than outside. Also, we were visiting during Lent so some of the decorations and statues were covered or put away. However, the fresco paintings on the ceilings were incredible and everything about the place was very impressive.</p>

You can see the Inn River snaking through the city. The village of Hungerburg looked quite similar to the ones at the bottom of the mountain near the city, except much quieter and windier. Taking the cable car up the mountain was also a fun experience and afforded some great views.</p>

It was originally meant to commemorate the marriage of her son (who would eventually become Emperor Leopold II), except Maria's husband Kaiser Franz died during the marriage. Therefore, the south façade of the arch is happy and represents the marriage, while the north façade is sad and represents the mourning of the late Kaiser. As the photo shows, many buses, cabs, and bikes regularly go through the arch in normal daily traffic.</p>

        <p>For me, the most enjoyable aspect of Seefeld was definitely the forests, trails, birds, and nature; this is what we couldn't find as easily in Innsbruck or Salzburg. We took a long hike through the snowy forests and hills surrounding the village, and marveled at all the unusual birds we'd never see back home. While this photo may make it look like the dead of winter, it was surprisingly not too cold or windy there. The crisp, clean mountain air is the number one thing I won't forget about Seefeld.</p>

        <p>Although not as centrally-located as St. Oswald, the Seekirchl Chapel is maybe the most iconic church in Seefeld. When the unsual-looking church was first built in 1629, it was in the middle of the man-made Kreuzsee lake, which was drained in 1807 (thus its nickname "Little Church in the Lake"). We also enjoyed watching people learn how to cross-country sky just outside. We weren't able to go inside the church, but it provided some great photo opportunities.</p>

        <p>I <em>loved</em> Salzburg, I absolutely loved every aspect of it. Where Innsbruck and Seefeld were more rural and mountainous, Salzburg was more of the "major European city." There were more pedestrian-only areas than Innsbruck, which made it seem cleaner and more walkable. The Salzach River that cuts through the middle of the city was beautiful to walk along, and take photos of from its bridges. This photo was taken later in the day as the sun was setting.</p>

        <p>The Benedictine monastery of Nonnberg Abbey was made famous through Maria Augusta von Trapp, and the movie <em>The Sound of Music</em>. Maria was a postulant in the abbey on a hill above Salzburg after World War I, and was later married there. However, the abbey has a much deeper history dating back to the year 714 when it was founded by St. Rupert and his niece St. Erentrude. We climbed a steep hill to get up to the abbey, and were overwhelmed by the feeling of peace and holiness in the place. While inside the church, I lit a candle and said a prayer just outside the crypt where St. Erentrude is buried.</p>

There are so many beautiful, domed cathedrals in Salzburg that this one is often overlooked by visitors—though it's just as beautiful. It was built in the 17th century on the same site as a 13th century hospital for victims of Bubonic plague and leprosy. I love the hard shadows cast on these buildings by the late afternoon sun, in the Nonntal area of Salzburg.</p>

I personally saw an iron gravestone dating back to the 800s (though Wikipedia says the oldest is from the 1200s), and the cemetery itself dates back to about 700 (which is when St. Peter's Abbey was built). It is—together with the cemetery at Nonnberg Abbey (seen above)—the oldest in the German-speaking world. The plants, flowers, and crucifixes decorating the gravesites were all so ornate and unique that I stepped very carefully.</p>
