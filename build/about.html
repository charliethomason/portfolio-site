  <h1>About Charlie Thomason</h1>
  <p>My full name is Charles Lee Thomason, Jr. and I’m a Front-end Web Developer and Artist living in Chicago, Illinois. I was born in Red Bank, New Jersey in 1984, went to high school &amp; college in Kentucky, and moved to Chicago in 2008.</p>
  <p>My specialties as a Web Developer include web accessibility, responsive CSS, cross-browser compatibility, and rapid prototyping. I am currently employed full-time as a Presentation Layer Engineer for <a target="_blank" href="http://razorfish.com">Razorfish</a>, where I’ve been happily coding since January 2013. I studied web development at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> (then known as Code Academy) in early 2012, and received my Masters in New Media Studies from DePaul University in 2010.</p>
  <p>I've always been a visually creative person, and earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Studio from the University of Kentucky in 2007. Today, I still enjoy doing art as a hobby. I especially enjoy working with watercolor and ink painting, drawing, and photography. In 2012, I self-published a photography book called <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range">Open Range</a></em>. Since 2014, I've been working on paintings of birds from the Chicagoland area.</p>
  <p>I currently live in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago with my fiancé, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amandablakley.com">Amanda</a>, and our 2 cats, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_TG_1frPPR/" target="_blank">Baxter and Chloe</a>. I love movies, auto racing, LEGO, and playing guitar, bass, and piano. I am a happy, healthy, open-minded person and love traveling the world.</p>

  <h2>About this website</h2>
  <p>Although this website does not feature a true portfolio of my work as a Web Developer, I hope that <em>the website itself</em> will function as an example of my front-end coding skills. The entire site I designed and built from scratch. The only things on this site I did not personally create are <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">imagesLoaded plugin</a> (used for the "loading" effect in the art &amp; photo galleries). The content is all static HTML, built using <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Handlebars</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grunt</a>. The CSS was compiled from Sass, and borrows from <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eric Meyer's CSS Reset</a>. The galleries were custom-built with my own JavaScript. The site is hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Pages</a>. The blog is hosted on Tumblr, using a custom, responsive Tumblr theme I built from scratch, and a customized version of <a href="http://fancybox.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fancybox</a>. If you want to see more of how the site is built, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/charliethomason/portfolio-site" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">view the source code for this website</a>. If you're interested in how the art and photo galleries work, you can <a href="https://github.com/charliethomason/portfolio-site/blob/master/src/js/scripts.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">view the JavaScript I wrote here</a>.</p>
