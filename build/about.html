  <h1>About Charlie Thomason</h1>
  <p class="intro">My name is Charlie Thomason and I'm a Front-end Web Developer and Artist living in Chicago, Illinois. I love photography, auto racing, movies, traveling, birds, and playing guitar and piano. This website features some of my best paintings and photos, and my blog.</p>
  <p>I was born in Red Bank, New Jersey in 1984, went to high school &amp; college in Kentucky, and moved to Chicago in 2008. I currently live in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago with my wife, <a target="_blank" href="http://amandabee287.tumblr.com">Amanda</a>, and our 2 cats, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_TG_1frPPR/" target="_blank">Baxter and Chloe</a>.</p>
  <p>My specialties as a Web Developer include web accessibility, responsive CSS, cross-browser compatibility, and JavaScript/jQuery. I am currently employed full-time as a Presentation Layer Engineer for <a target="_blank" href="http://razorfish.com">Razorfish</a>, where I’ve been happily coding since January 2013. I received my Masters in New Media Studies from DePaul University in 2010, and studied web development at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> in early 2012.</p>
  <p>I've always been a visually creative person, and earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Studio from the University of Kentucky in 2007. Today, I still enjoy doing art as a hobby. I especially enjoy working with watercolor and ink painting, drawing, and photography. In 2012, I self-published a photography book called <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range">Open Range</a></em>. Since 2014, I've been working on paintings of birds of the Chicagoland area.</p>

  <h2>About this website</h2>
  <p>Although this website does not feature a true portfolio of my work as a Web Developer, I hope that <em>the website itself</em> will function as an example of my front-end coding skills. The entire site I designed and built from scratch. The content is all static HTML, built using <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Handlebars</a>, <a href="https://github.com/assemble/assemble/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Assemble</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grunt</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a>, and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sass</a>. The main site is hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Pages</a>, and the blog is hosted on Tumblr using a custom Tumblr theme. If you want to see more of how the site is built, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/charliethomason/portfolio-site" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">view the source code for this website</a>.</p>
