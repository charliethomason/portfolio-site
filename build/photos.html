It rained non-stop for 48 hours (from noon Friday until noon Sunday), but then the skies cleared and we were treated to what most fans agree was the most exciting F1 race of the whole 2015 season. Lewis Hamilton not only won the race, but secured the 2015 World Drivers Championship with his victory. However, it was not an easy win, as Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo also took turns leading the race. Scuderia-Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel started 15th (due to a grid penalty) but still managed to work his way up to 3rd. There were several restarts due to accidents, which kept the cars close together, which led to more exciting battles. By the end, we were soaking wet and covered up to our knees in mud, but feeling like we had just witnessed motorsports history. Everyone stormed out onto the track, and my Dad took the above photo of us on the main straight. It was my fourth F1 grand prix (having attended the Indianapolis U.S. Grand Prix twice and the 2010 Italian Grand Prix), and Amanda's first F1 race.</p>

            <p class="description">On September 26, 2015, I went on the longest, best bike ride I'd ever taken. It was the last truly warm day of the summer (around 75 degrees), and I rode 17 miles from the South Loop to Hyde Park and back. I started at my apartment near the Museum Campus on Roosevelt Rd, went down S Indiana Ave, through the Prairie District, then took the bridge over the train tracks near 18th and Calumet, rode by Soldier Field, and then headed south on the lakefront bike path. Once I got to Promontory Point at 55th St, I exited the bath path, went past the Museum of Science of Industry and down Stony Island, then turned right onto the beautiful Midway Plaisance. I rode to 60th and Cottage Grove, then headed back. I took this photo between Woodlawn and Ellis, with Harper Memorial Library visible in the background. The first glimpses of Fall had blown through a few days earlier, which left some trees with splashes of orange and yellow. Despite how fast I rode along the lakefront, I went extra slowly through Hyde Park, just so I could savor every lovely second of it. It was, without doubt, the best bike I've ever taken.</p>

            <p class="location">Chicagoland Speedway, Joliet, IL</p>
            <p class="description">On September 20, I attended my first-ever NASCAR race: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_myAFibRisk.com_400" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2015 myAFibRisk.com 400 at Chicagoland Speedway</a>. I went with Amanda, her brother Michael, and her Dad, and it was a beautiful day. It was an historic race as Jeff Gordon tied the record for most consecutive starts at 788. It also took place during Gordon's final year in NASCAR, and saw him lead the race for 40 laps. Denny Hamlin ultimately won the race, despite crashing earlier on. It being my first time seeing NASCAR live, I was amazed at how loud it was &mdash; possibly even louder than F1 used to be. The near-deafening roar of the engines at starts and restarts is a sound I will never forget, and is one aspect of the race that can not be fully-appreciated on TV. The above photo &mdash; taken at the beginning during a formation lap &mdash; captures some NASCAR stereotypes, such as the American flag bandana and mullets. But in reality, the race helped me learn to really appreciate NASCAR and see beyond the stereotypes that lead some to view it as the sport of rednecks. You really don't know anything about NASCAR until you've seen a race live. I'm happy that I learned to appreciate the sport before Jeff Gordon retired.</p>

I love the bright, early evening haze that casts the city in a sortof glow. You can see several landmarks quite clearly in the photo, including my own apartment building. This is probably my favorite photo I've ever taken out an airplane window, and demonstrates the iPhone 6's amazing camera quality.</p>

            <p class="description">In September 2015, we went on a vacation with my Mom's family to Blackwater Falls State Park in Davis, West Virginia. While we were there, we did a lot of hiking and enjoyed the natural beauty of the place. This waterfall was among the more spectacular sights we saw, though it was also one of the most touristy and crowded. The water level was somewhat low at this time, due to lack of rain, so the falls were not as big as they usually are. Nevertheless, it was a great experience and we really enjoyed the peace and quiet of this remote place.</p>

            <p class="description">On August 2, I attended the 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Indy_200" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio</a> for the second time. Despite having attended previously in 2013, this was the first time where I felt like a knowledgable IndyCar fan, having watched most of the season's races leading up to it. The race was significant for a few reasons. First, hometown favorite Graham Rahal won the race (wearing a helmet designed like the Ohio State Buckeyes football helmets), thirty years after his father Bobby Rahal won at Mid-Ohio. Also, Justin Wilson got second place, just three weeks before his fatal accident at Pocono Raceway. Lastly, it represented the race where I reconsidered which IndyCar drivers and teams I would cheer for. I came to the race planning to cheer for Penske's Juan Pablo Montoya (whose car is seen above), but came away feeling like more of a fan of Graham Rahal (Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing) and Scott Dixon (Chip Ganassi Racing). Since we had paddock passes, we were able to walk through pits and onto the track. The above photo was taken while walking along the main straight prior to the race. It was a phenomenal race, on a very hot summer day, and forever cemented me as an IndyCar fan.</p>

            <p class="location">Navy Pier, Chicago, IL</p>
            <p class="description">One of the best ways to enjoy a beautiful summer day in Chicago is to take a Water Taxi from the Museum Campus up to Navy Pier. We did this several times in July 2015, but on this particular occasion I was lucky to see a Double-Crested Cormorant close-up, standing on a breakwater near the Pier (we got even closer to it than this photo shows). They are one of my favorite birds and seemed totally unafraid of the Water Taxi, nor was it intimidated by the millions of seagulls. Another significance of this photo is the old Ferris Wheel, which was taken down a few months later, to be replaced by a larger one. This photo also shows Navy Pier at the height of the summer tourism season, when it can be very crowded and exciting.</p>

            <p class="description">Despite having spent many summers in Emerald Isle, NC (1990-1999, 2004, 2007, and 2013-2015), I had never taken a tour of Fort Macon State Park, on Bogue Banks near Atlantic Beach. The fort was primarily used during the Civil War (first by the Union, then the Confederacy, then the Union again), and was occupied again by troops during the Spanish-American War, and even during World War II. It's interesting to see the way the fort is laid out, with an inner moat surrounding the five-sided middle building. It contains 26 vaulted rooms, with 4.5 feet thick walls. All along the outside, you can see where it's been hit by cannons (it was struck 560 times during the 1862 Battle of Fort Macon). I enjoyed learning the history of this place, and felt this was a good photo of myself.</p>

            <p class="description">Growing up, my mother's family would go to Emerald Isle, North Carolina every summer (1990-1999, 2004, and 2007). We unfortunately stopped going as a family afer 2007, but in 2013 my parents, girlfriend, and I resurrected the tradition on a smaller scale. We came back again in 2014 and 2015, and the above photo was taken with my iPhone 6 on the last morning of our stay in 2015. The beautiful glow of the early morning sun on the sand and water is something that cannot be fully captured in a photo, but I feel this photo conveys the warmth and heavenly nature of this special place.</p>

            <p class="description">I grew up watching Formula 1 races with my Dad, and in April 2015 got to experience the first-ever season of Formula-E racing. My Dad and I spent a long weekend watching these all-electric open-wheel cars zip around the streets of Long Beach, California. While most forms of auto racing don't allow fans to get very close to the track, I was amazed at how close to the action we could get at the Formula-E race. The above photo was taken with my iPhone 6 on lap 1 of the ePrix, at a small, raised viewing stand near turn 3, at the corner of Pine Ave and Shoreline Dr. You can see, from left to right, Jarno Trulli for his Trulli team, Bruno Senna for the Mahindra team, Stéphane Sarrazin for the Venturi team, and Jérôme d'Ambrosio for the Dragon Racing team. The cars didn't make much noise, nor did they go super fast like F1, but the race was quite thrilling and we witnessed motorsport history.</p>

We originally met in Park City, UT at the 2009 festival, returned again in 2010 and 2011, and were engaged to be married at Sundance 2015. There is such an exciting, energetic atmosphere on Park City's Main Street during Sundance — even during inclement weather. This photo was taken near the end of the festival, when things had died down a bit, and I was able to get a great view of the famous Egyptian Theatre. I love all the lights strung across the road and along the buildings, and can't wait to go back again someday.</p>

I had been to nearby Rockport once before—in Summer 2007 for a cinematography workshop—and fell in love with the quaint, seaside fishing town of Camden. Amanda and I stayed at the Historic Whitehall Inn, and one day sailed out into West Penobscot Bay aboard the Schooner Olad. While on the historic sailing ship, we got an amazing view of Curtis Island and its Lighthouse. The weather was a typical Maine summer day: 70 degree temps, partly cloudy, and fairly windy. Using my Nikon D7000 with Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 wide-angle lens, I was able to get some great shots of the Bay, Island, town, and distant hills. Maine became one of my favorite places in the U.S., and I could imagine myself retiring there some day.</p>

            <p class="description">The Monadnock Building was built between 1891 and 1893 in the historic neighborhood of Printer’s Row. It is an incredibly large and heavy load-bearing masonry building, designed by both Burnham & Root and Holabird & Roche—2 of Chicago's most famous architectural firms. The grand staircases found throughout the building represent the first use of aluminum in building construction. This high-dynamic range (HDR) photograph was created with 5 photos at incremental exposure settings.</p>

            <p class="description">For this chapter in my book <a href="http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range" target="_blank"><em>Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert</em></a>, my girlfriend Amanda and I were staying at the Ace Hotel & Swim Club in Palm Springs, CA and took a long drive out to Joshua Tree. It was my 27th birthday and, on the drive there, John Lennon's "Imagine" came on the radio. It was brutally hot in the middle of summer and there were many large insects everywhere, but it was one of the most amazing places I've ever been. The area is massive and filled with some of the most unique trees, cacti, and flora I've ever seen. I unfortunately only had my Panasonic G1 dSLR on me during this part of the trip, but I think capturing the landscape in its truest-to-life, most realistic colors helps illustrate the surreal atmosphere of this area between the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. I chose to highlight the above photograph with the "No Trespassing" sign as it illustrates the strange suggestion that, within a National Park, people can look but not touch.</p>

            <p class="description">The Grand Canyon chapter of my book <a href="http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range" target="_blank"><em>Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert</em></a> was uniquely challenging for 3 reasons. First, it was never originally supposed to be a part of the book at all; we ended up stopping there spontaneously after we left Monument Valley. Second, it is perhaps one of the most-photographed and popular destinations in the world. And lastly, we didn't have as much to spend there as at the other spots in my book. Nevertheless, it's hard to take a bad photo of the Grand Canyon. This particular photo is a high-dynamic range image that I captured by wandering down a steep, narrow path near one of the main overlooks. I like to think I captured the timeless beauty of this American wonder.</p>

            <p class="description">Some of the most beautiful sights I saw while shooting my book <a href="http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range" target="_blank"><em>Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert</em></a> were found not within a National Park but just along the side of the road as we traveled through the deserts of Arizona and Utah. For this reason, I decided to create a special chapter of random photos that wouldn't fit in any of the other chapters. I of course borrowed the chapter's name from the title of Jack Kerouac's most famous book. Some of these photos were taken out the car window while driving; others were taken by just pulling over to the side of the road. I also took several Polaroid photos using my Dad's old Polaroid Sun 600 and actual Polaroid film I saved from before they stopped producing it. The above Polaroid photo has some red dust on the outer edges, which is from when I opened the car door and several of the Polaroids blew out of the car and tried to escape into the desert. After finally catching all the Polaroids, I opted to keep the red sand on them, for added authenticity and artistic effect.</p>

Although both the Navajo National Monument and Monument Valley are located in the Navajo Nation, these two places are quite different. The Navajo National Monument consists of 3 ancient Anasazi cliff dwellings from the 13th century, located within the Tsegi Canyon in northern Arizona. As opposed to the barren rocks and desert grass of Monument Valley, the Navajo National Monument is filled with a broad variety of trees, birds, and reptiles. I found that the wide range of values and high contrast produced by the high-dynamic range (HDR) process was perfect for bringing out the detail in these trees and ruins.</p>

            <p class="description">The time I spent in Monument Valley, on the Navajo Reservation, was the most rewarding part of my first photography book <a href="http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range" target="_blank"><em>Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert</em></a>. I had learned of this special place in my college film classes, as the setting for many of John Ford's films. I was overwhelmed by the beauty, peacefulness, quietness, and spiritual holiness of the place and tried to be respectful of the land and of the Navajo people while I was there. The above 35mm film photo shows a rock formation that someone later told me looks like a skull. I also love this particular image because it captures the interesting hard shadows created as the sun goes down over the Valley. Deserts can be very beautiful in the day, but also very dark and mysterious at night.</p>

            <p class="description">People are often surprised to learn that I'm an avid kayaker. Sometimes kayaking allows me to capture photos I could never dream of taking on land. Such was the case in shooting the Lake Powell chapter of my book <a href="http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range" target="_blank"><em>Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert</em></a>. Given that it's the second-largest man-made body of water in the U.S. (after Lake Mead), I thought I could get a more intimate portrayal of this unique landscape by traveling through its canyons and canals by kayak. The iridescent blue water, contrasted against the hot red landscape, is made more vivid by the compositions the kayak allowed. Plus, I feel like so much desert photography makes the landscape look very Martian and devoid of human life; I wanted my own photos to show that this was a journey that I personally took through Lake Powell. A photo of a lake shows only a lake, but a photo of someone exploring a lake can tell a story.</p>

I love the way they captured the serene, yet slightly mysterious nature of Venice at night. The water appears so calm and the buildings, bridges, and boats seem to rise out of the shadows.</p>

In Summer 2008, Amanda and I were driving from Portland, OR to Multnomah Falls, but decided to stop along the way at Wahkeena Falls. We ended up liking it better than Multnomah; even though it's smaller, it's less touristy and has some great hiking trails. This rocky bridge that goes by the falls looks great against the greenery and cool, rushing water. This was the closest I could get without my camera getting wet, but is framed nicely and captures the peacefulness of the place.</p>

            <p class="description">In early 2008, right after finishing my BFA degree, I took a trip to England with my Dad, to take 35mm film photos for a solo exhibition. I wanted to capture what I called "the real England," rather than the touristy London I had seen a few years earlier. One essential part of this was, of course, to visit the beautiful English countryside. So one day, we took a bus from Sheffield way out into the countryside of South Yorkshire, eventually arriving in the villages of High Bradfield and Low Bradfield (which are, as their names suggest, at the top and bottom of a hill, respectively). At that time, it was the most serene, lush, and peaceful place I had ever been (and this was in late winter). High Bradfield is home to the fifteenth century Church of St. Nicholas, where this photo was taken. The surrounding graveyard was full of headstones and grave markers that dated back to medieval times, and allowed for some fantastic photographs. When I returned from the trip, I developed my film and prints in the University of Kentucky darkroom and held a one-month exhibit of my best work, entitled "The English Portfolio," at the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington.</p>

For the above photo, I wanted to show this epic cathedral silhouetted in the background, with an old cobblestone street and middle class buildings in the foreground. The photo was taken near sundown, which allowed for some wonderful hard shadows. When I returned from the trip, I developed my film and prints in the University of Kentucky darkroom and held a one-month exhibit of my best work, entitled "The English Portfolio," at the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington.</p>

            <p class="description">Growing up, my mother's family would go to Emerald Isle, North Carolina every summer (1990-1999, 2004, and 2007). These photos were taken in 2007, which was the last year we all went there as a family. I took this photo with my 35mm film SLR camera, and used it for one of my undergraduate classes the following Fall semester. It was taken underneath the Bogue Inlet Fishing Pier, which is always a popular destination on the island. The pier has been partially destroyed by hurricanes and rebuilt a few times since this was taken.</p>
