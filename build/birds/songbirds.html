          <p class="description">My parents lived in a rural area of Kentucky for about 12 years, and the 3 birds I remember the most from that time are the Eastern Meadowlark, American Kestrel, and Northern Cardinal. I fondly recall seeing little groups of Meadowlarks huddled together in the winter snow, still singing as sweetly as they did in the summer. They can be found year-round in both Kentucky and Chicago, with their bright yellow breast and beautiful song making them easily recognizable. Being the second painting completed for this project, it's unique in that I only applied the correct color to the yellow breast and throat. The rest of the bird would normally be brown, not gray, but I wanted the yellow to be accentuated as much as possible.</p>

          <p class="description">Blue Jays may be bright and beautiful (and are one of my favorite birds), but they have a reputation to be noisy, aggressive pests, and will even attack or kill other songbirds. However, it can also be helpful to smaller birds, as it will bravely chase away hawks and owls, and scream its loud call when dangerous predators are near. So for this painting, I chose to portray the bird loudly crying out, in the heart of my favorite Chicago neighborhood, Printer's Row. For many years, this lovely historic district of the South Loop was home to many printing and publishing businesses, but today it is mostly residential. My wife Amanda and I lived in Printer's Row for 2 years and still spend much time there. The restaurant on the left, Hackney's, was our favorite Friday night spot for many years, until it closed in 2016. In the background stands Dearborn Station, which is where we had our wedding rehearsal dinner. While much of the South Loop (and Chicago as a whole) is rapidly growing and changing, Printer's Row has seen very little construction or demolition and still looks much the same as it did many decades ago. Nevertheless, the Blue Jay sounds its loud call to alert us that large predators may be closing in.</p>

          <p class="description">Bilateral gynandromorphism is a very rare condition where half of an organism is male and the other half is female. It can be seen in birds, butterflies, lobsters, and other insects and crustaceans. In this painting, the Cardinal on the left is female, the one on the right is male, and the one in the middle is a gynandromorph. In the Wilson Journal of Ornithology, a professor from Western Illinois University wrote about a <a href="http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-northern-cardinal-cardinalis-cardinalis-half-male-half-female-plumage-rock-island-illinois-02449.html" target="_blank">Bilateral Gynandromorph Cardinal that was observed in Rock Island, IL</a> from December 2008 through March 2010. He reported that, while it interacted peacefully with other Cardinals, it was never observed singing or pairing with other Cardinals. As far as I can find, I am the only person to ever paint one of these rare creatures.</p>
