          <p class="description">Millions of people flock to the Art Institute of Chicago each year, including my wife and I who are members there. It is one of the oldest art museums in the United States, and in 2014 was rated by Tripadvisor as the best museum in the world. Despite all of this, few people take time to appreciate the lovely South Garden just outside the main entrance. With the trees, plants, flowers, ivy-covered walls, and large fountains, it's a peaceful spot to relax and watch birds. For this painting, I chose to paint Rose-breasted Grosbeaks because, just like the artwork found inside the museum, they are very beautiful and unique. I included a pair of them, because I rarely ever visit the Art Institute by myself, and am usually with my wife. This painting is one of several in this book where the background setting took far longer to paint than the birds in the foreground, and is one of my personal favorites.</p>

          <p class="description">My parents lived in a rural area of Kentucky for about 12 years, and the 3 birds I remember most from that time are the Eastern Meadowlark, American Kestrel, and Northern Cardinal. I fondly recall seeing little groups of meadowlarks huddled together in the winter snow, still singing as sweetly and loudly as they did in the summer. They can be found year-round in both Kentucky and Chicago, with their bright yellow breast and beautiful song making them easily recognizable. Being the second painting completed for this project, it's unique in that I only applied the correct color to the yellow breast and throat. The rest of the bird would normally be brown, not gray, but I wanted the yellow to be accentuated as much as possible. It is also one of the few in the book that does not have a notable background location, as it was completed prior to deciding on the Chicagoland setting.</p>

          <p class="description">Blue Jays may be bright and beautiful (and are one of my favorite birds), but they have a reputation to be noisy, aggressive pests, and will even attack or kill other songbirds. However, they can also be helpful to smaller birds, as they will bravely chase away hawks and owls, and scream their loud call when dangerous predators are near. So for this painting, I chose to portray the bird loudly crying out, in the heart of my favorite Chicago neighborhood, Printer's Row. For many years, this lovely historic district of the South Loop was home to many printing and publishing businesses, but today it is mostly residential. My wife Amanda and I lived in Printer's Row for 2 years and still spend much time there. The restaurant on the left, Hackney's, was our favorite Friday night spot for many years, until it closed in 2016. In the background stands Dearborn Station, where we had our wedding rehearsal dinner in 2016, and was once a major transportation hub of the Midwest. While much of the South Loop (and Chicago as a whole) is rapidly growing and changing, Printer's Row has seen very little construction or demolition and (at least on the outside) still looks mostly the same as it did decades ago. Still, the Blue Jay sounds its warning call that larger predators may be closing in.</p>

          <p class="description">Bilateral gynandromorphism is a very rare condition where half of an organism is male and the other half is female. It can be seen in birds, butterflies, lobsters, and other insects and crustaceans. In this painting, the cardinal on the left is female, the one on the right is male, and the one in the middle is a gynandromorph. In the December 2014 <em>Wilson Journal of Ornithology</em>, a professor from Western Illinois University wrote about a <a href="http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-northern-cardinal-cardinalis-cardinalis-half-male-half-female-plumage-rock-island-illinois-02449.html" target="_blank">bilateral gynandromorph cardinal he observed in Rock Island, IL</a> from December 2008 through March 2010. He reported that, while it interacted peacefully with other cardinals, it was never observed singing or pairing with other cardinals. As far as I can find, I am the only person to ever paint one of these rare creatures. Besides the gynandromorph's unique appearance, I have always loved how the male and female cardinals are beautiful but in different ways. I purposefully chose to not give the painting a background, so that the unique colors and features of the cardinals would be the primary focus.</p>

          <p class="description">At the corner of 18th Street and Prairie Avenue is one of the most historically, architecturally, and personally significant houses in Chicago: the Glessner House. Designed by famous architect Henry Hobson Richardson, it is also one of the most important and innovative residential homes of the nineteenth century. John Jacob Glessner, a partner in a large farm machinery manufacturing firm, commissioned the house and lived there with his wife from 1887 until his death in 1936. Today it is a museum, complete with most of the Glessner Family's original decorations and furniture. In the middle of the house is a large private courtyard, which is where, in July 2016, my wife and I held our wedding reception. My reason for pairing this important location with a Red-winged Blackbird is two-fold. First, it is one of the few birds other than sparrows and crows that I distinctly remember seeing there. The second reason is more symbolic: the beautiful red and yellow coloring on the Red-winged Blackbird is often concealed under a sort of black feather-flap; without these colors it looks just like any other crow or blackbird. Similarly, the Glessner House is beautiful, but it is what's concealed inside that makes it so unique and special.</p>
