  <h1>About Charlie Thomason</h1>
  <p class="intro">My name is Charlie Thomason and I'm a Software Engineer and Artist living in Chicago, Illinois. I love auto racing, movies, traveling, <a href="/birds/">birds</a>, and playing guitar and piano. This website features some of my best paintings, photography, and web development samples.</p>
  <p>I was born in Red Bank, New Jersey in 1984, went to high school &amp; college in Kentucky, and moved to Chicago in 2008. I currently live in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago with my wife, <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/Amanda_bee">Amanda</a>, and our 2 cats, Baxter and Chloe.</p>
  <p>My specialties as a Software Engineer include JavaScript, API integration, responsive CSS, and web accessibility. I have been a full-time Software Engineer at <a href="http://uptake.com" target="_blank">Uptake</a> since March 2017. Prior to that, I was a Presentation Layer Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="http://razorfish.com">Razorfish</a> for 4 years. I received my Masters in New Media Studies from DePaul University in 2010, and studied web app development at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> in early 2012.</p>
  <p>I've always been a visually creative person, and earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Studio from the University of Kentucky in 2007. Today, I still do art as a hobby, and enjoy working with watercolors, ink, and photography. In December 2016, I self-published a book of paintings of birds found in Chicago entitled <em><a href="/birds/">Birds of Chicagoland: Paintings by Charlie Thomason</a></em>. Other subject matters I enjoy painting include movies, history, and auto racing.</p>

  <h2>About this website</h2>
  <p>This entire website is intended to serve as an example of my front-end web development skills. Everything on this site I designed and built from scratch (with the exception of some elements in the 'Code' section demos). The content is all static HTML, built using <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Handlebars</a>, <a href="https://github.com/assemble/assemble/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Assemble</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Grunt</a>, and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sass</a>. The JavaScript is all plain, vanilla JavaScript (except in certain code demos). The main site is hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github Pages</a>. If you want to see more of how the site is built, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/charliethomason/portfolio-site" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">view the source code for this website</a>.</p>
