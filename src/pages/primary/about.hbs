  <h1>About Charlie Thomason</h1>
  <p class="intro">My name is Charlie Thomason and I'm a Front-end Web Developer and Artist living in Chicago, Illinois. I love photography, <a href="/etc/autoracing.html">auto racing</a>, movies, traveling, <a href="/birds/">birds</a>, and playing guitar and piano. This website features some of my best paintings and photography, web development demos, and a blog.</p>
  <p>I was born in Red Bank, New Jersey in 1984, went to high school &amp; college in Kentucky, and moved to Chicago in 2008. I currently live in the South Loop neighborhood of Chicago with my wife, <a target="_blank" href="http://amandabee287.tumblr.com">Amanda</a>, and our 2 cats, <a href="http://charliethomason.tumblr.com/post/135230488781/my-kittens-like-each-other-sometimes">Baxter and Chloe</a>.</p>
  <p>My specialties as a Web Developer include JavaScript/jQuery, API integration, responsive CSS, and web accessibility. I have been a full-time Software Engineer at <a href="http://uptake.com" target="_blank">Uptake</a> since March 2017. Prior to that, I was a Presentation Layer Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="http://razorfish.com">Razorfish</a> for 4 years. I received my Masters in New Media Studies from DePaul University in 2010, and studied web development at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.starterleague.com/">The Starter League</a> in early 2012.</p>
  <p>I've always been a visually creative person, and earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Art Studio from the University of Kentucky in 2007. Today, I still enjoy doing art as a hobby. I especially enjoy working with watercolor and ink painting, drawing, and photography. In December 2016, I self-published a book of paintings of birds found in Chicago entitled <em><a href="/birds/">Birds of Chicagoland: Paintings by Charlie Thomason</a></em>. I spent over 2 years working on the bird painting book, and personally consider it to be my masterpiece.</p>
