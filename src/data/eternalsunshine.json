        "description": "For a long time, I had wanted to paint a tribute to the film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (directed by Michael Gondry and written by Charlie Kaufman). The scene at the bottom of the image is when Jim Carrey's character Joel, in a dream, appears in front of a dilapidated version of his own childhood home. Joel looks up to the sky in frustration and fear as he fights against his memories being erased. Compositionally, I made it so Joel is looking up to the sky, but also at Clementine; Clementine is looking away because, at that point, she has already erased Joel from her memory. This is one of the paintings I did while working out of a temporary studio in downtown Columbus, OH in May 2012."
