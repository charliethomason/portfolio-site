We knew we would cry 2 times on our honeymoon: right after we arrived in Venice, and right before we left. It had been 6 years since we were last in Venice, and we had forgotten how unbelievably beautiful it is."

Located in the Santa Croce sestiere, right by the Fontago dei Turchi, this family-owned lodging is very special and unique. We stayed in the room on the very top floor, which features an \"<em>altana</em>,\" or roof-top deck.

At night the only sounds you heard were an occasional boat passing by on the nearby Grand Canal. Surrounded by terracotta roofs, it was so peaceful, private, and perfect."

        "description": "One of my goals for our visit to Venice was to recreate some of the photos I had taken on our previous visit in 2010. The challenge in doing this is that Venice can be hard to navigate, so finding some of these locations again was quite hard. Luckily, the architecture of Venice hasn't changed much in the last few centuries so it was a fun challenge. In fact, the image quality of my photos has changed quite a bit more than the subject matter itself. The canal in these 2 photos is located just around the corner from our hotel, so it was one of the first things I recognized upon our return."

But for me, the image that most evokes the look and feel of Venice is the lovely, narrow canals and gothic arches above windows and doors. I noticed this perfect view of the Rio de San Polo canal, in the San Polo district (or \"<em>Sestiere</em>\"), on our first walk from the hotel down to the Rialto Bridge area. It's amazing for me to think that, in over 1000 years, very little about this particular view has changed, except the glass panes in some windows, and motors on boats."

We got our wish at Riva del Vin, where we were seated so close to the Canal that the water actually splashed up on my foot (after which a couple of seagulls laughed at me). For my meal, I chose to be adventurous and ordered <em>Seppie alla Venezia con Polenta</em>, or Venetian Cuttlefish in a black ink sauce with polenta. It was amazingly delicious (quite salty though). It was a perfect first meal of the trip, as we enjoyed being right by the Canal and the Rialto Bridge, in the heart of the city."

Today, they exist as more of a fun and pleasant ride, whereas the Vaporetto water buses are the quicker, cheaper way to get around. A typical Gondola ride costs about â‚¬80 and lasts about 30min.

Along the walk from the Rialto Bridge to St. Mark's, it was hard to not stop at every single bridge and take photos. This particular one was non-optional though. It, for me, epitomized the quintessential Venetian canal scene: warm red buildings, cool green water, a quaint little bridge, flowers in windows, and a gondolier with a red-striped shirt and blue ribbon hat. This photo is now the desktop wallpaper on my computer."

In the 1000 years that the Republic of Venice existed, the church was never the city's official cathedral; it wasn't until 1807 that it earned that designation. During its lifetime, the Basilica and its surrounding Piazza have undergone many changes, fires, and enhancements. When I first saw the Basilica in 2010, I had never seen such a beautiful building in my whole life. Since literally thousands of photos are taken of this building every single day, I wanted mine to look unique. Using my wide-angle lens, I was able to capture this interesting perspective, which highlights the intricate details and awesomeness of the St. Mark's."

Like most other buildings surrounding the Piazza San Marco, it has been changed and expanded many times over its lifetime. There is no better example of Venetian Gothic architecture than this amazing Palazzo. As you can see in some later photos, the interior is even more amazing than the outside. I tried to capture it from the same sort of angle as the above photo of the Basilica."

There are probably 3 pigeons for every 1 human. This area in front of the Doge's Palace where the Piazza meets the water is called the Piazzetta. The two columns at the southern end of the Piazzetta feature statues of the Lion of St. Mark and St. Theodore (who was the patron saint of Venice prior to St. Mark). For many years gambling was permitted in this area, and public executions sometimes took place between the two columns. Today it is a beautiful area filled with souvenir vendors, outdoor cafes, and hundreds of humans and pigeons."

Across the Bacino from St. Mark's, you can see the small island of San Giorgio Maggiore, which is adjacent to the larger island of the Giudecca. Despite San Giorgio Maggiore's proximity to the Giudecca, it is part of the San Marco Sestiere, whereas Giudecca is part of the Dorsoduro Sestiere. The edge of the Piazzetta San Marco along the Bacino is sometimes called \"The Molo,\" which is part of the much longer Riva degli Schiavoni, which stretches all along the southern border of the San Marco and Castello sestieri."

Although it's not always on display, it's Amanda's favorite painting of all-time. So when we came to Venice, I wanted to take a photo of the church that evokes Marieschi's painting. The Basilica is situated at the eastern-most tip of the Dorsoduro island, where the Giudecca Canal and Grand Canal meet and feed into the Bacino di San Marco. Since the area across the Canal from the Basilica is mostly private patios and restaurants, this little dock was the best angle I could get for my photo. The Basilica was constructed in the mid-17th century, as an offering to help deliver the city from an outbreak of the plague."

There is a term in photography known as the \"golden hour\" where the sun is redder and at an angle, right before sunset. This photo perfectly captures that moment, as the sun illuminates the warm colors of the buildings across the canal, and creates cool, contrasting shadows. When I look at this photo now, it almost brings tears to my eyes as the place almost doesn't look real, yet I remember sitting in that spot like it was yesterday."

The fish barges start delivering their stock at dawn, and the vendors start selling around 8 a.m. By noon, everything has been sold and most of the vendors have already cleared out.

Andrea Gritti was one of the great Doges in the early 16th century. The Sala del Collegio was the room where foreign delegations and important persons were received by the Doge and his six councilors."

This is where meetings were held by the Doge and the Great Council, the most important political body in the Venetian Republic. When a fire in 1577 destroyed part of the Palace, an old 14th-century fresco painting in this room was destroyed. To replace it, Jacopo Tintoretto and his son Domenico created, \"Il Paradiso,\" the massive painting you see on the wall in the back. It is, in fact, <strong><em>the largest canvas painting in the world</em></strong>, and is truly awesome to behold. In addition to Tintoretto's masterpiece, there are dozens of amazing paintings all throughout the room, and the golden ceiling is simply beyond description.

I was fortunate to capture this photo right as a pigeon was flying right over the Bridge and several gondolas were passing underneath.

It is, however, arguably just as important as the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Basilica. If the Rialto represents the Venetian Republic's economy, and St. Mark's represents its religious traditions, then the Arsenale represents an equally vital part of its history: the building of warships and maritime trading ships. The present structure was built in 1104, though there's evidence that ships were built in this area as early as the 8th century. At one time, it spanned 110 acres (about 15% of Venice) and was <strong><em>the largest industrial complex in Europe until the Industrial Revolution</em></strong>. Although Henry Ford is often credited with inventing the modern assembly line, the process was arguably in practice for hundreds of years through the Venetian Republic's mass-production of ships.

        "description": "Our first gondola ride of the trip was like a dream, and easily my favorite of the 3 total Venetian gondola rides I've taken in my life. The gondolier actually had his young son with him and told us that the gondolier tradition has been passed down from father to son in their family for generations. He took us from Campo Santa Maria Mater Domini out onto the Grand Canal, then back down the Rio del Megio, which connects to the Rio del Boldo. Both of these run very close to Ca' San Giorgio, our hotel, in the peaceful Santa Croce sestiere."

You're really not supposed to tip gondoliers, but I gave him an extra â‚¬2 \"for your boy,\" which he seemed to appreciate. He was truly a seasoned expert in the gondolier tradition, and a very polite and pleasant gentleman. He would sing and whistle as we slowly glided through the very quiet canals, and would make a sortof \"<em>oi oi oi</em>\" call before turning a blind corner. I am not exaggerating when I say that this particular gondola ride was one of the best experiences of my whole life."

While the exterior of the church is a fairly simple plain brick in the Italian Gothic style, the interior is overwhelmingly beautiful."

However, they made one exception to this law when the plague took the life of the great Venetian painter, Titian, who was interred in this great tomb in the Frari. Titian's birthdate is unknown, but when he died he was somewhere between his late eighties and 100 years old. In the top middle of the tomb you can see an engraving of Titian's most famous work, \"The Assumption of the Virgin,\" which still hangs in the high altar of the Frari."

Walking through the area, we noticed a lot more of what looked like locals and people who were just going to work and running errands.

The main artery of the island is the Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta, which leads directly from the vaporetto stop on the Laguna Veneta side of the island, over to the beaches on the Adriatic Sea side. There are many shops and hotels along this street and, while it feels more like an American beach town than an island in Northern Italy, it is just as beautiful and fun."

Mainland Venice is obviously amazing and full of history and beautiful sights, but sometimes when you're on vacation you just want to sit in the sand, put your feet in the water, and relax. While there are many private beaches and resorts, the most popular are of course the free public beaches. The Adriatic Sea was the warmest water I've ever experienced. The island has a lot of history also: in 1177 the Treaty of Venice was signed here; in 1202 soldiers from the Fourth Crusade covered the island; and in the mid-19th century it became one of the first \"sea bathing\" beaches in the world."

Whereas most people nowadays arrive on the north side via train, car, or plane, hundreds of years ago many visitors would have likely arrived by boat from the south and seen this view first.

This photo was taken in the late evening, before it was totally dark, as we were headed out for a walk. It received a very positive response from my Facebook friends, as it captures Venice at a special moment, with the dark blue sky and yellow lamps reflecting on the water. The palace across the Canal, Ca' Vendramin Calergi, is now home to both the Venice Casino and Wagner Museum. The famous composer Richard Wagner died of a heart attack there in February 1883, and stayed six other times in his life."

This one was taken on the Ponte delle Guglie, which is the first bridge you reach as you walk northeast from Santa Lucia station. As I was taking the photo, a police boat with its lights on sailed underneath the bridge and afforded me this cool shot.

Although it is now a museum, it doesn't really feel like one as the furniture and art are organized to give it an authentic palazzo feel. The building has a lot of history: Carlo Rezzonico (of the namesake family) went on to become Pope Clement XIII; the late 19th century painter Robert Barrett Browning owned, restored, and lived in the palazzo for about 20 years; and American composer Cole Porter once rented out the whole place for a month in the 1920s.
