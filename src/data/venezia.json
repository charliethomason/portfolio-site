We exited the train station and walked over the Ponte degli Scalzi bridge, where we took this photo. We knew we would cry 2 times on our honeymoon: right after we arrived in Venice, and right before we left. It had been 6 years since we were last in Venice, and we had forgotten how unbelievably beautiful it is."

Located in the Santa Croce sestiere, right by the Fontago dei Turchi, this family-owned lodging is very special and unique. We stayed in the room on the very top floor, which features an \"<em>altana</em>,\" or roof-top deck. The people who run Ca' San Giorgio were so helpful and friendly, and made our trip so much more special."

Ours was the only room that had one and it came to epitomize the relaxation part of our vacation. We ended every day on the altana drinking wine and staring up at the stars. At night the only sounds you heard were an occasional boat passing by on the nearby Grand Canal. Surrounded by terracotta roofs, it was so peaceful, private, and perfect."

        "description": "One of my goals for our visit to Venice was to recreate some of the photos I had taken on our previous visit in 2010. The challenge in doing this is that Venice can be hard to navigate, so finding some of these locations again was quite hard. Luckily, the architecture of Venice hasn't changed much in the last few centuries so it was a fun challenge. In fact, the image quality of my photos has changed quite a bit more than the subject matter itself. The canal in these 2 photos is located just around the corner from our hotel, so it was one of the first things I recognized upon our return."

        "description": "For some people, the best views in Venice are of St. Mark's and other old churches; for others, it's the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge. But for me, the image that most evokes the look and feel of Venice is the lovely, narrow canals and gothic arches above windows and doors. I noticed this perfect view of the Rio de San Polo canal, in the San Polo district (or \"<em>Sestiere</em>\"), on our first walk from the hotel down to the Rialto Bridge area. It's amazing for me to think that, in over 1000 years, very little about this particular view has changed, except the glass panes in some windows, and motors on boats."

        "description": "For our first meal in Venice, we wanted to eat somewhere as close to the Grand Canal as possible. We got our wish at Riva del Vin, where we were seated so close to the Canal that the water actually splashed up on my foot (after which a couple of seagulls laughed at me). For my meal, I chose to be adventurous and ordered <em>Seppie alla Venezia con Polenta</em>, or Venetian Cuttlefish in a black ink sauce with polenta. It was amazingly delicious (quite salty though). It was a perfect first meal of the trip, as we enjoyed being right by the Canal and the Rialto Bridge, in the heart of the city."

        "description": "For hundreds of years, Gondolas were the primary mode of public transportation around Venice. Today, they exist as more of a fun and pleasant ride, whereas the Vaporetto water buses are the quicker, cheaper way to get around. A typical Gondola ride costs about â‚¬80 and lasts about 30min. I found this particular Gondola parked near the Rialto Bridge and use the opportunity to get a cool up-close shot with my wide-angle lens."

        "description": "After our first meal of the trip, it was time to go visit Venice's main tourist spot, St. Mark's Square. Along the walk from the Rialto Bridge to St. Mark's, it was hard to not stop at every single bridge and take photos. This particular one was non-optional though. It, for me, epitomized the quintessential Venetian canal scene: warm red buildings, cool green water, a quaint little bridge, flowers in windows, and a gondolier with a red-striped shirt and blue ribbon hat. This photo is now the desktop wallpaper on my computer."

        "description": "The current Basilica San Marco dates back to the mid-11th century, though there were 2 previous versions of the church that date back to 832. In the 1000 years that the Republic of Venice existed, the church was never the city's official cathedral; it wasn't until 1807 that it earned that designation. During its lifetime, the Basilica and its surrounding Piazza have undergone many changes, fires, and enhancements. When I first saw the Basilica in 2010, I had never seen such a beautiful building in my whole life. Since literally thousands of photos are taken of this building every single day, I wanted mine to look unique. Using my wide-angle lens, I was able to capture this interesting perspective, which highlights the intricate details and awesomeness of the St. Mark's."

        "description": "The Doge's Palace, located right next to St. Mark's Basilica, was the residence of the ruler of the Venetian Republic during it's existence from the 7th century through 1797. Like most other buildings surrounding the Piazza San Marco, it has been changed and expanded many times over its lifetime. There is no better example of Venetian Gothic architecture than this amazing Palazzo. As you can see in some later photos, the interior is even more amazing than the outside. I tried to capture it from the same sort of angle as the above photo of the Basilica."

        "description": "The Piazza San Marco is obviously full of hundreds of tourists every single day. But the other lifeform in this Square that easily outnumbers human beings are the pigeons. There are probably 3 pigeons for every 1 human. This area in front of the Doge's Palace where the Piazza meets the water is called the Piazzetta. The two columns at the southern end of the Piazzetta feature statues of the Lion of St. Mark and St. Theodore (who was the patron saint of Venice prior to St. Mark). For many years gambling was permitted in this area, and public executions sometimes took place between the two columns. Today it is a beautiful area filled with souvenir vendors, outdoor cafes, and hundreds of humans and pigeons."

        "description": "The Piazzetta San Marco is fronted by the Bacino di San Marco, which is part of the Laguna Veneta, which is part of the Adriatic Sea. Across the Bacino from St. Mark's, you can see the small island of San Giorgio Maggiore, which is adjacent to the larger island of the Giudecca. Despite San Giorgio Maggiore's proximity to the Giudecca, it is part of the San Marco Sestiere, whereas Giudecca is part of the Dorsoduro Sestiere. The edge of the Piazzetta San Marco along the Bacino is sometimes called \"The Molo,\" which is part of the much longer Riva degli Schiavoni, which stretches all along the southern border of the San Marco and Castello sestieri."

        "description": "At the Art Institute of Chicago, there is a painting by Michele Marieschi from 1741 titled simply, \"The Church of Santa Maria della Salute\" (<a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/55621\" target=\"_blank\">you can see it on their website here</a>). Although it's not always on display, it's Amanda's favorite painting of all-time. So when we came to Venice, I wanted to take a photo of the church that evokes Marieschi's painting. The Basilica is situated at the eastern-most tip of the Dorsoduro island, where the Giudecca Canal and Grand Canal meet and feed into the Bacino di San Marco. Since the area across the Canal from the Basilica is mostly private patios and restaurants, this little dock was the best angle I could get for my photo. The Basilica was constructed in the mid-17th century, as an offering to help deliver the city from an outbreak of the plague."

        "description": "At the end of our first day in Venice, Amanda and I sat along the Grand Canalâ€”not far from where we had lunch earlier that dayâ€”and ate gelato. There is a term in photography known as the \"golden hour\" where the sun is redder and at an angle, right before sunset. This photo perfectly captures that moment, as the sun illuminates the warm colors of the buildings across the canal, and creates cool, contrasting shadows. When I look at this photo now, it almost brings tears to my eyes as the place almost doesn't look real, yet I remember sitting in that spot like it was yesterday."
