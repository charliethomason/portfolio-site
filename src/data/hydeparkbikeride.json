        "description": "On September 26, 2015, I went on the longest, best bike ride I'd ever taken. It was the last truly warm day of the summer (around 75 degrees), and I rode 17 miles from the South Loop to Hyde Park and back. I started at my apartment near the Museum Campus on Roosevelt Rd, went down S Indiana Ave, through the Prairie District, then took the bridge over the train tracks near 18th and Calumet, rode by Soldier Field, and then headed south on the lakefront bike path. Once I got to Promontory Point at 55th St, I exited the bath path, went past the Museum of Science of Industry and down Stony Island, then turned right onto the beautiful Midway Plaisance. I rode to 60th and Cottage Grove, then headed back. I took this photo between Woodlawn and Ellis, with Harper Memorial Library visible in the background. The first glimpses of Fall had blown through a few days earlier, which left some trees with splashes of orange and yellow. Despite how fast I rode along the lakefront, I went extra slowly through Hyde Park, just so I could savor every lovely second of it. It was, without doubt, the best bike I've ever taken."
