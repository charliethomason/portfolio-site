        "description": "This painting of Jim Clark driving his iconic Lotus Formula One car was given to my Dad as a Christmas present in 2014. I decided to post it on my website today (March 4, 2015), as it would have been Jim’s 79th birthday. He is considered by some to be the greatest F1 driver in history. This portrait depicts Clark driving the Lotus 49 at the 1968 British Grand Prix — the last race Clark ever won (or finished) before his untimely death. The Lotus 49 featured a V8 Ford-Cosworth DFV engine, which is one of the most successful engines in F1 history. This was one of the first paintings of a car I had done in many years and I’m very pleased with it."
