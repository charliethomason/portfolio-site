        "description": "One of the best ways to enjoy a beautiful summer day in Chicago is to take a Water Taxi from the Museum Campus up to Navy Pier. We did this several times in July 2015, but on this particular occasion I was lucky to see a Double-Crested Cormorant close-up, standing on a breakwater near the Pier (we got even closer to it than this photo shows). They are one of my favorite birds and seemed totally unafraid of the Water Taxi, nor was it intimidated by the millions of seagulls. Another significance of this photo is the old Ferris Wheel, which was taken down a few months later, to be replaced by a larger one. This photo also shows Navy Pier at the height of the summer tourism season, when it can be very crowded and exciting."
