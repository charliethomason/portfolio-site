        "description": "I've always been a huge Star Wars fan but this was my first attempt to do a painting based on that universe. From left to right there is a Clone Trooper from the prequel trilogy, an Imperial Stormtrooper from the original trilogy, and a First Order Stormtrooper from the sequel trilogy. One of the most difficult parts of this was finding photos to paint from that all had the same lighting direction, with the troopers pointed in the correct directions. This painting was done while I was in the midst of working on my <a href=\"/birds\">Bird Book</a> and wanting to just take a break."
