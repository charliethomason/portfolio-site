        "description": "I’ve always enjoyed listening to Frederic Chopin’s music while doing art, so I figured I owed him a portrait for all the inspiration he provided me. This painting was one of a few I completed at an art studio I leased in downtown Columbus, Ohio in May 2012. When I researched existing portraits of Chopin, I noticed that he looks very different from one portrait to the next. Due to the constant illness he suffered in life, there were dramatic differences in his facial features depending on the year it was created. My portrait was based primarily on Louis-Auguste Bisson's daguerrotype photo of Chopin (taken right before his death), as well as an 1847 painting of him by Ary Scheffer. In the top of the painting, I transcribed a few measures of Chopin’s Sonata No. 2 in Bb minor. To the right of Chopin, I depicted the sculpture of the muse of music, Euterpe, who sits atop Chopin’s tomb in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris."
