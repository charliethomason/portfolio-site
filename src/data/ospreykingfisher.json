        "description": "This was given to my Dad as a Christmas 2015 gift. Growing up in New Jersey, my Dad and I would go to a nearby pond where we'd see ospreys and kingfishers. I love the size contrast between these two birds, and yet how similar they are. They both eat fish, yet obviously not the same size fish, so they can live peacefully near each other. It was also a lot of fun to paint the Belted Kingfisher's head, which sort-of resembles a mohawk (this being the female Kingfisher). In the future, I plan to do a larger portrait of a kingfisher."
