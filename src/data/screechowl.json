        "description": "Although this Screech Owl painting will appear in my forthcoming bird painting book, it was completed months before I even had the idea to do such a book. In fact, the success it found on Instagram was part of what inspired me to further pursue birds as a subject matter for my art. The painting is all India Ink on watercolor paper, and I think it works quite well with such high-contrast values and no color. It was given as a present to my Mother and now hangs in their living room."
