        "description": "This portrait I painted is based on a stranger I saw in the French Quarter district of New Orleans, LA in Spring 2010. When I first posted it online, someone left me a comment saying his name is \"Stroker.\" The background was based on a different photography I took while in New Orleans, and I must say I quite enjoyed painting those green doors. The area that looks unfinished in the lower left corner symbolizes how no one will ever know the full story behind this man. I should also mention that I gave him a couple dollars after taking his photo."
