        "description": "I started with this photo because, when I returned back to cold, gray Chicago, this was the image of Southern California that was stuck in my mind. While our hotel was in Pacific Beach, we spent a lot of time in the neighborhood just to the north, La Jolla. Besides the beaches, cliffs, and beautiful ocean, the area is home to a variety of wildlife â€” most of which was in its breeding season during our visit. My favorite bird, the Cormorant, Amanda's favorite bird, the Pelican, and dozens of seals and sea lions covered the rocks and cliffs. In this photo, you can see a Brown Pelican in the lower left corner, and there a dozen or so Cormorants on a guano-covered rock in the right-center area in the midground."

        "description": "We looked at several different hotels in San Diego, but ultimately decided to stay up near the beaches, rather than somewhere near downtown. This proved to be a great decision, and the Tower23 Hotel in Pacific Beach was very unique, modern, comfortable, and conveniently-located. After booking the hotel, we learned that several people we know had previously stayed here and all loved it. A boardwalk/walking/biking path runs in front of the hotel and connects Pacific Beach with Mission Beach to the south. When we first arrived, we were too early to check in to our room, so we took a long walk along this boardwalk. We would walk it many more times during the trip."

        "description": "As soon as we were able to check into our hotel room, we knew we were in for a really special trip. We discovered that not only did the hotel have free bikes to rent, and a beautiful balcony with ocean view in our room, but they even brought free cocktails up to our room shortly after arrival. This photo was actually taken at the very end of the trip, which makes it more meaningful; at this point, we had spent many amazing nights and beautiful mornings sitting out on this balcony, and it was one of the hardest things to leave. I spent every morning out on this patio, drinking coffee, listening to the waves crash, and smelling the salty sea air."

        "description": "The Tower23 Hotel is right on the beach, and looks out at the Crystal Pier (a.k.a. the Pacific Beach Pier), which is open from 7am until sunset every day. You can see there are actually little houses along the pier, available for rent, and people would even park their cars on the pier in front of the houses. During high tide, the waves would pound against the pier so hard that you could feel the pier shake. Numerous surfers would be out in this area every day, usually first thing in the morning and again around sunset, no matter the weather. We found the mid-60s sunny temperatures to be wonderful, but for the locals that was apparently considered too chilly."

        "date": "Friday, February 3",
        "description": "There were so many restaurants and bars all along the Pacific Beach boardwalk that, if you came for a week and did nothing but eat, you still probably couldn't hit them all. One of our favorites was the Baja Beach Cafe, who specialize in large plates of brunch and Mexican food, and even larger margaritas. The place was very brightly colored and always just felt like a party. It seemed like every time we walked past it along the boardwalk, we at least briefly considered stopping. It was nothing fancy, but it was everything you could want from a fun, casual, beachside bar and grill."

        "description": "As I mentioned above, we would watch the sunset every day from the end of the Crystal Pier by our hotel. There would always be a decent-sized crowd up there. Growing up on the East Coast, there is just something amazing about watching the sun set into the ocean. This was the first of many selfies we took on the trip, but arguably the best. You can see several surfers in the background, trying to catch some of the big waves. This photo would be just about perfect if it weren't for that one piece of my hair flying up in the wind."
