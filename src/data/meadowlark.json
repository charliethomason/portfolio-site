        "description": "This is one of the birds I painted for my second book, which is a collection of paintings of birds found in the Chicagoland area. It was the second painting I intentionally did for the book and was completed in November 2014. What makes it unique among the paintings for that book is that the only color applied is for the bird's bright yellow breast; the brown parts of the bird are done in gray with ink. I remember seeing these birds all year round in my parent's backyard growing up, and the most clearly identifying feature was always the yellow breast with the black ring around its neck. I'm very happy with how this turned out, especially the range of values in its wings. I opted not to give this painting a background, so that all the attention would be on the yellow breast and ink detail."
