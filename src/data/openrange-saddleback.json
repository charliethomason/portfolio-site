        "description": "I used this photo for the cover of my first book, <em>Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert</em>. The rock formation in the photo is called Saddleback Mesa. I took this photo just after midnight on the outskirts of Monument Valley. I chose this photo as the cover of the book because of its compositional symmetry and color balance. I also named the book \"Open Range\" because of the road sign in the photo."
