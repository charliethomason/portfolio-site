        "description": "In September 2015, we went on a vacation with my Mom's family to Blackwater Falls State Park in Davis, West Virginia. While we were there, we did a lot of hiking and enjoyed the natural beauty of the place. This waterfall was among the more spectacular sights we saw, though it was also one of the most touristy and crowded. The water level was somewhat low at this time, due to lack of rain, so the falls were not as big as they usually are. Nevertheless, it was a great experience and we really enjoyed the peace and quiet of this remote place."
