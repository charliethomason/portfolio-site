        "description": "In late 2009, my cousin James Stone contacted me about designing the cover for a local New Jersey history book he had written. \"The Murder of Mingo Jack: New Jersey's only nineteenth century lynching\" tells the story of Samuel \"Mingo Jack\" Johnson, who was wrongfully accused of lynching a white girl. In 1886, he was lynched by an angry mob at a jail lockup in Eatontown, New Jersey—not far from where my cousin and I grew up. As there are no existing photographs of Mingo, this meant that my painting would become the only portrait ever made of this man. Following the release of this book, a memorial marker was installed at the spot where Mingo Jack was lynched. My cousin James has appeared at numerous events and book signings for the book, including one at the Monmouth County Library in Shrewsbury, NJ—right down the street from where I grew up. It was an honor to see my artwork displayed in that public library, after all the time I had spent there as a child."
