        "description": "This is the largest work of art I have ever completed, consisting of three separate 2' x 4' MDF wood board panels. In addition to water-soluble oil paints, I used newspapers from around the world, cookbook pages, restaurant advertisements, and construction blueprints. It was completed at the end of my undergraduate career and I knew I'd need to get a \"real job\" soon. While I knew this \"real job\" wouldn't involve painting or drawing, I felt that ALL jobs involve creative thought. I wanted to show non-art-related professions that require some form of creativity. I used myself as a model to show that this was a personal struggle, not just a societal observation."
