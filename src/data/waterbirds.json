        "description": "This was the first painting I completed after deciding to make all the birds Chicago-based. It was completed a few months after attending Riot Fest 2014 in Humboldt Park, where the Field House had been a backdrop for several performances. As a result of the Festival, much of the landscape in the park was destroyed, which took over a year to fully repair. The Great Blue Heron has been one of my favorite birds ever since I was little. While you aren't likely to find any in downtown Chicago, they can certainly be found near ponds in some parks and more rural areas. In my experience, they are not very afraid of humans and I've managed to get quite close to them."

        "description": "In my opinion, there is no more unique or iconic-looking duck than the Wood Duck. For this painting, I chose to render the background only in black-and-white, so that the diverse array of colors on the duck could be accentuated. There are greens, purples, reds, yellows, browns, and blues all within this bird, although when you see one in the wild you'd likely only notice a green head and brown body. It's easy to find these birds in the North and South Ponds of Lincoln Park, along with many other ducks, herons, and waterfowl. As with many of these paintings, the background took at least as long to paint as the bird, given my desire to portray Chicago as accurately as possible. Despite how difficult certain aspects of this piece were, it was among the most enjoyable for me to paint."

        "description": "Although Black Crowned Night Herons are quite common in Lincoln Park, they are actually an endangered species. Most of them nest near the South Pond, where the Lincoln Park Zoo has been tracking their breeding numbers since 2007. Although they are not in captivity, the Illinois Wildlife Preservation Fund provides fencing each year to protect their main nesting area. If you ever see this fenced-in breeding area, it can look a bit \"post-apocalyptic\" as the grass grows very tall and the Herons cover the park benches. The are much smaller than their Great Blue Heron relatives, at only about 2 feet tall and less than 2 pounds. They are a remarkable example of a rare and endangered species managing to survive in a bustling metropolis like Chicago."

        "date": "September-October 2015",
        "description": "The Double-Crested Cormorant is possibly my favorite bird. After reading about them in Richard J. King's excellent book, \"<em>The Devil's Cormorant</em>,\" I gained enormous respect for them. I first discovered the book in Camden, Maine after seeing many Cormorants along the waterfront there, drying out their wings after diving for food. While the Double-Crested Cormorants can dive up to 25 feet underwater for up to 70 seconds, other Cormorant species can dive as deep as 150 feet. These birds are viewed very differently across the world: while many in the American sports fishing and fish farming industries view them as pests and trash birds who hurt their business, in Japan and China they have been respected and trained for traditional Cormorant fishing since the 10th century. In Peru, Northern Chile, and the Pacific Islands they have been the primary source of guano, which became an economically valuable export. In Chicago, they can been seen in the late summer and early autumn months, along the Lake Michigan breakwaters and near Navy Pier. They are peaceful birds who, unlike seagulls and geese, will only eat fish and generally avoid humans. This is the only painting in the book that I went back and re-painted after being unhappy with the first version. I painted the bird with a white double crest, although this is only seen during breeding season and is sometimes black instead of white."
