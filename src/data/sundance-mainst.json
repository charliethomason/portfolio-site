        "description": "In January 2015, Amanda and I returned to the Sundance Film Festival for the 4th time. We originally met in Park City, UT at the 2009 festival, returned again in 2010 and 2011, and were engaged to be married at Sundance 2015. There is such an exciting, energetic atmosphere on Park City's Main Street during Sundance â€” even during inclement weather. This photo was taken near the end of the festival, when things had died down a bit, and I was able to get a great view of the famous Egyptian Theatre. I love all the lights strung across the road and along the buildings, and can't wait to go back again someday."
