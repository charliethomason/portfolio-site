        "description": "I was very fortunate to attend the 101st Running of the Indianapolis 500 on May 28, 2017. It was my very first Indy 500, though not my first time at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, having been there for the 2002 and 2004 F1 U.S. Grands Prix. I was joined for the race by my wife Amanda, my Dad, and 300,000 other fans, making it the largest sporting event in the world. Sitting in the Southwest Vista, we had an excellent view of the action, and thoroughly enjoyed one of the best races I've ever seen. The race was significant in part because it featured F1 driver Fernando Alonso (seen in this photo in the orange #29 car) driving for the newly-formed McLaren-Honda-Andretti team &mdash; the first time an active F1 driver had driven the Indy 500 since 1984. Following behind Alonso in this photo are fellow Andretti drivers Ryan Hunter-Reay and 2016 race winner Alexander Rossi, as well as my personal favorite driver, Helio Castroneves (in 4th). We were very lucky that the race ended up being totally dry, given that massive thunderstorms were predicted all the way up until that very morning."
