        "description": "The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_States_Grand_Prix\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2015 Formula 1 U.S. Grand Prix</a> at Circuit of the Americas in Austin was one of the most amazing, memorable car races I've ever attended (click the link to read more about the weekend's drama). It rained non-stop for 48 hours (from noon Friday until noon Sunday), but then the skies cleared and we were treated to what most fans agree was the most exciting F1 race of the whole 2015 season. Lewis Hamilton not only won the race, but secured the 2015 World Drivers Championship with his victory. However, it was not an easy win, as Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo also took turns leading the race. Scuderia-Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel started 15th (due to a grid penalty) but still managed to work his way up to 3rd. There were several restarts due to accidents, which kept the cars close together, which led to more exciting battles. By the end, we were soaking wet and covered up to our knees in mud, but feeling like we had just witnessed motorsports history. Everyone stormed out onto the track, and my Dad took the above photo of us on the main straight. It was my fourth F1 grand prix (having attended the Indianapolis U.S. Grand Prix twice and the 2010 Italian Grand Prix), and Amanda's first F1 race."
