        "description": "Near the end of my undergraduate career, I became obsessed with the B-movie filmmaker Roger Corman and his adaptations of the works of Edgar Allen Poe. Despite being some of his most professional-looking films, most were completed in about 2 weeks. For this painting, I wanted to implement a visual style that was representative of Cormanâ€™s high quality/fast production methods. To achieve this, I tried to focus on realistic-looking faces, while making other elements look like I took shortcuts. This rough/polished dichotomy later became a staple of much of my paintings, where the goal is to create a discourse between realism and abstraction. The canvas itself was handmade and engineered to have the exact same dimensions as a 16:9 aspect ratio movie frame."
