        "description": "I started watching NASCAR racing in 2014, but didn't find a favorite team or driver until 2015, when I discovered Wood Brothers Racing. Their young driver, Ryan Blaney, was neighbors with Dale Earnhardt Jr and was a reported Star Wars geek. The Wood Brothers team is the oldest currently-active team in NASCAR and has a long history of success with their famous red and white #21 car. This painting depicts (from left to right): the 1963 car co-driven by Glen Wood, which won the Owner's Championship; the 1976 car driven by David Pearson, which won the Daytona 500 and the NASCAR Triple Crown; and the 2017 car driven by Ryan Blaney, which brought the Wood Brothers their 99th win at Pocono."
