It is an incredibly large and heavy load-bearing masonry building, designed by both Burnham & Root and Holabird & Roche—2 of Chicago's most famous architectural firms. The grand staircases found throughout the building represent the first use of aluminum in building construction. This high-dynamic range (HDR) photograph was created with 5 photos at incremental exposure settings."

Although both the Navajo National Monument and Monument Valley are located in the Navajo Nation, these two places are quite different. The Navajo National Monument consists of 3 ancient Anasazi cliff dwellings from the 13th century, located within the Tsegi Canyon in northern Arizona. As opposed to the barren rocks and desert grass of Monument Valley, the Navajo National Monument is filled with a broad variety of trees, birds, and reptiles. I found that the wide range of values and high contrast produced by the high-dynamic range (HDR) process was perfect for bringing out the detail in these trees and ruins."

I took this photo just after midnight on the outskirts of Monument Valley. I chose this photo as the cover of the book because of its compositional symmetry and color balance. I also named the book \"Open Range\" because of the road sign in the photo."

The 2 images were shown again at the Center for Neighborhood Technology from February to August 2013, and are now part of a permanent collection held by the Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail. This image was created with high-dynamic range (HDR) editing."
