        "description": "Growing up, my mother's family would go to Emerald Isle, North Carolina every summer (1990-1995, 1997-1999, 2004, and 2007). We unfortunately stopped going as a family afer 2007, but in 2013 my parents, girlfriend, and I resurrected the tradition on a smaller scale. We came back again in 2014, 2015, and 2017, and the above photo was taken with my iPhone 6 on the last morning of our stay in 2015. The beautiful glow of the early morning sun on the sand and water is something that cannot be fully captured in a photo, but I feel this photo conveys the warmth and heavenly nature of this special place."
