        "description": "I grew up watching Formula One racing with my dad, and was always a fan of Michael Schumacher and the Scuderia Ferrari team. Most F1 fans will tell you that the Monaco Grand Prix is their favorite race, and I am no exception. This painting depicts the 2001 race, which Schumacher won. The background is the area known as Beau Rivage, which features several beautiful buildings along a hill near the beginning of the circuit. The late-90s/early-2000s era was, in my opinion, the best years of F1 racing, with the best cars and most exciting races."
