        "description": "On August 2, I attended the 2015 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Indy_200\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honda Indy 200 at Mid-Ohio</a> for the second time. Despite having attended previously in 2013, this was the first time where I felt like a knowledgable IndyCar fan, having watched most of the season's races leading up to it. The race was significant for a few reasons. First, hometown favorite Graham Rahal won the race (wearing a helmet designed like the Ohio State Buckeyes football helmets), thirty years after his father Bobby Rahal won at Mid-Ohio. Also, Justin Wilson got second place, just three weeks before his fatal accident at Pocono Raceway. I went to the race planning to cheer for Penske's Juan Pablo Montoya, but came away with a lot of new favorite drivers. Since we had paddock passes, we were able to walk through pits and onto the track. The above photo was taken while walking along the main straight prior to the race. It was a phenomenal race, on a very hot summer day, and forever cemented me as an IndyCar fan."
