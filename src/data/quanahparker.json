        "description": "After reading \"Empire of the Summer Moon\" by S.C. Gwynne, I was inspired to do a portrait of Quanah Parker—the last chief of the Comanche Indians, and one of the very last North American Indian chiefs to surrender to the U.S. Government. Quanah was born of a Comanche man and a white woman, who had been captured as a child and raised in the Comanche tradition. I was inspired by Quanah’s intense facial features, but also by the intensity of his eyes, which appear very keen yet somewhat empty inside. This piece is also a great example of my attempt to execute proper cross-hatching, which contrasts the more fluid brushwork found in my paintings."
