        "description": "The Monadnock Building was built between 1891 and 1893 in the historic neighborhood of Printer’s Row. It is an incredibly large and heavy load-bearing masonry building, designed by both Burnham & Root and Holabird & Roche—2 of Chicago's most famous architectural firms. The grand staircases found throughout the building represent the first use of aluminum in building construction. This high-dynamic range (HDR) photograph was created with 5 photos at incremental exposure settings."
