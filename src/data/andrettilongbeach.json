        "description": "The 1986 CART race in Long Beach, California produced the first career win for Michael Andretti. In the race, he competed against his father, Mario Andretti, who was by then a seasoned veteran. The painting depicts a battle between the father and son during that race, along the main straightaway, with Michael in front in the #18 Kraco Racing car, and Mario in back in the #5 Newman/Haas racing car. I was fortunate to see a <a href=\"/gallery/formulae-longbeach.html\">Formula E race at Long Beach</a> in April 2015 and have loved that street circuit ever since. In this painting, I tried to depict the audience grandstands as an abstract mix of colors. This was one of the first paintings I did after completing my <a href=\"/birds\">Bird Book</a>."
