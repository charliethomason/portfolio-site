        "description": "The Grand Canyon chapter of my book <a href=\"http://www.blurb.com/b/2868673-open-range\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert</em></a> was uniquely challenging for 3 reasons. First, it was never originally supposed to be a part of the book at all; we ended up stopping there spontaneously after we left Monument Valley. Second, it is perhaps one of the most-photographed and popular destinations in the world. And lastly, we didn't have as much to spend there as at the other spots in my book. Nevertheless, it's hard to take a bad photo of the Grand Canyon. This particular photo is a high-dynamic range image that I captured by wandering down a steep, narrow path near one of the main overlooks. I like to think I captured the timeless beauty of this American wonder."
