        "description": "This is a study of <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/97907\" target=\"_blank\">Frederic Remington's 1889 \"A Mexican Vaquero\", which resides at the Art Institute of Chicago</a>. It was the first oil painting I had attempted in 6 years, having stuck to watercolor &amp; ink for a long time. It was also the first time I had ever painted a horse. I always had a bad habit of using water to thin my water-soluble oil paints, and this was my first attempt to change that habit; I used only linseed oil for thinner, and water only for cleanup. I also avoided using any black paint for this, and created the darker values with red, blue, and brown. It was a nice reintroduction to oil painting."
