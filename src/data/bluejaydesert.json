        "description": "A blue jay would die in the desert. It would take years for it to adapt to that kind of climate and environment, and there are far too many native desert creatures that would prey upon it. The background of this watercolor and Ink Paintings is Monument Valley, Utah, and is adapted from a photograph seen in my book, “Open Range: From Monument Valley to the Mojave Desert”. For this painting, I wanted to try a new style: something more multi-colored and less sad-looking than my previous work; the blue jay’s cold blues would contrast the warm, earthy tones of the sacred Navajo land. Another significance of this painting is that it was the last piece I did at my temporary art studio in downtown Columbus, Ohio in May 2012."
