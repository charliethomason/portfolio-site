        "description": "In July 2014, Amanda and I took a road trip up through the New England area, starting in Boston and ending in Camden, Maine. I had been to nearby Rockport once before—in Summer 2007 for a cinematography workshop—and fell in love with the quaint, seaside fishing town of Camden. Amanda and I stayed at the Historic Whitehall Inn, and one day sailed out into West Penobscot Bay aboard the Schooner Olad. While on the historic sailing ship, we got an amazing view of Curtis Island and its Lighthouse. The weather was a typical Maine summer day: 70 degree temps, partly cloudy, and fairly windy. Using my Nikon D7000 with Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 wide-angle lens, I was able to get some great shots of the Bay, Island, town, and distant hills. Maine became one of my favorite places in the U.S., and I could imagine myself retiring there some day."
