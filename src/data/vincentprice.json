        "description": "It seems fitting that the best ink portrait I did during my undergraduate years (in my opinion) was of my favorite actor, Vincent Price. Of all the portraits I’ve ever painted, I still feel that this is the best likeness. I feel that the way I controlled the gray values and colors here is among my best. The background the portrait is original, but loosely based on Tim Burton’s “Edward Scissorhands” (Price’s last film). I sold this drawing to a college roommate of mine in 2007."
