  "intro": "Here is a small sampling of the web development work I've done over the past few years. Due to the confidential nature of some client work, all names, logos, branding, fonts, and images have been changed. In many cases, the parts of the code I worked on have been extracted from their original pages and/or software framework for the purpose of hosting them here. Many of these projects were a collaborative effort with other developers, so in some cases I cannot claim 100% responsibility. If you have questions or concerns about any of the work found here, please <a href=\"/about.html#contact-charlie\">contact me</a>.",
