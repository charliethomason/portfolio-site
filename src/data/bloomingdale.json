        "description": "The Bloomingdale Trail in Chicago was an old, abandoned, elevated train line that has been converted to a 3-mile long park, bike path, and art installation called <a href=\"http://the606.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The 606</a>. This photo was one of two entries accepted into an exhibit called \"<a href=\"https://reframingruin.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Reframing Ruin: A Prelude to the Bloomingdale Trail</a>\", which was part of the 2011 Milwaukee Ave Arts Festival. The 2 images were shown again at the Center for Neighborhood Technology from February to August 2013, and are now part of a permanent collection held by the Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail. This image was created with high-dynamic range (HDR) editing."
