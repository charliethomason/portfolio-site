        "description": "Despite having spent many summers in Emerald Isle, NC (1990-1999, 2004, 2007, and 2013-2015), I had never taken a tour of Fort Macon State Park, on Bogue Banks near Atlantic Beach. The fort was primarily used during the Civil War (first by the Union, then the Confederacy, then the Union again), and was occupied again by troops during the Spanish-American War, and even during World War II. It's interesting to see the way the fort is laid out, with an inner moat surrounding the five-sided middle building. It contains 26 vaulted rooms, with 4.5 feet thick walls. All along the outside, you can see where it's been hit by cannons (it was struck 560 times during the 1862 Battle of Fort Macon). I enjoyed learning the history of this place, and felt this was a good photo of myself."
