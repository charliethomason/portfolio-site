        "description": "This painting from my forthcoming Chicago bird art book is set at Starved Rock State Park in LaSalle County, IL. The bridge is meant to be a specific one near the LaSalle and Tonti Canyons. I've always loved the Pileated Woodpecker, but have only ever seen one in the wild once. I wanted to make the background as green as possible, to create a strong contrast against the red of the Woodpecker. This is part of a series of 4 paintings set at Starved Rock, which show the park in each season."
