        "description": "Growing up, my mother's family would go to Emerald Isle, North Carolina every summer (1990-1999, 2004, and 2007). These photos were taken in 2007, which was the last year we all went there as a family. I took this photo with my 35mm film SLR camera, and used it for one of my undergraduate classes the following Fall semester. It was taken underneath the Bogue Inlet Fishing Pier, which is always a popular destination on the island. The pier has been partially destroyed by hurricanes and rebuilt a few times since this was taken."
